    <td>Family involvement and support play an integral role in a child’s foundation in learning a language. It is a collaborative effort between schools and parents as they work together to support every step that the child takes to learn and develop his/her language skills. Exposure to the Tamil language at home gives the children more opportunities to use the language in everyday life and it will make the learning in school complete. In today’s session, participants will learn how to create authentic opportunities and apply innovative strategies that they can use at home to foster the child’s learning of the Tamil language. They will discover creative ways for children to speak and learn Tamil through simple play routines at home.  They will also gain an understanding of the new primary curriculum, how it facilitates learning of Tamil language in a fun and enjoyable manner in school and how it supports home based learning as well.

    <td>Story: A key to language learning </td>
     <td>Pedagogical theory strongly supports the use of stories in teaching languages to children. Keeping stories as the central part of language lessons not only contextualise language learning but also, pave the opportunity to illustrate and inspire young children. Carefully chosen activities related to the stories enable children naturally immerse in the experience as it provides a meaningful environment. Such proven strategy does not only belong to the educators or professionals. Anyone interested in a child’s learning and development could master this strategy utilising what is available in the environment. Effective parent involvement has been a crucial factor in children’s education, and the present situation with Home-Based Learning (HBL) as norm stresses the significance even more. Thus, this workshop will explore how parents, as well as educators, could use stories and related activities creatively to offer a Mother Tongue language-rich environment at home or in a classroom.
