       <p>The key issues currently amongst young Indian parents is on how to instil the interest in Tamil language and call-for action to do so with their young children. What they often miss is that, an interest for a language cannot be done via just tuitions, assessment books and practices. It has to be practical. It has to be fun. It has to be engaging and creative. In this workshop, I want to speak to the audience on how I never had any challenges getting my kids to speak Tamil or show interest in Tamil. But it takes effort to continuously cultivate this interest without the kids knowing that we want them to learn or show interest in this language. Key to success for this is to be discreet yet bold. And it takes the understanding of the concept and practical applications from parents to do so. Some examples will be merging learning with what we see, what we do and also to play along with what kids like to do. Kids love to imitate us, not just physically but also behaviourally. So why not make use of all these secret tools we have? That is the key focus in this session.

  <h4> Synposis</h4>  
       <p>Synopsis:Storytelling is a powerful medium to stimulate imagination in kids.  We all know that imagination plays a great role in enhancing a child’s creativity, fosters more confidence along with better communication and speaking skills. Engaging the children with a story is one of the most powerful means to influence and inspire the young minds. An effective storytelling can involve a deeper understanding of the human emotions and compassion, opening up to new ideas and free thinking. When we expose the children to a creative artistic environment through speech and drama, we are generating a stimulus for also developing their love for language and introducing new ideas into their small world.  The whole activity can be made fun and enjoyable through the right techniques of storytelling, interactivity and innovation. Let us make the mundane narratives more interesting for children.

  <h4> Synposis</h4> 
       <p>Family involvement and support play an integral role in a child’s foundation in learning a language. It is a collaborative effort between schools and parents as they work 
together to support every step that the child takes to learn and develop his/her language skills. Exposure to the Tamil language at home gives the children more opportunities to use the language in everyday life and it will make the learning in school complete. In today’s session, participants will learn how to create authentic opportunities and apply innovative strategies that they can use at home to foster the child’s learning of the Tamil language. They will discover creative ways for children to speak and learn Tamil through simple play routines at home.  They will also gain an understanding of the new primary curriculum, how it facilitates learning of Tamil language in a fun and enjoyable manner in school and how it supports home based learning as well.

  <h4> Synposis</h4>  
       <p>Pedagogical theory strongly supports the use of stories in teaching languages to children. Keeping stories as the central part of language lessons not only contextualise language learning but also, pave the opportunity to illustrate and inspire young children. Carefully chosen activities related to the stories enable children naturally immerse in the experience as it provides a meaningful environment. Such proven strategy does not only belong to the educators or professionals. Anyone interested in a child’s learning and development could master this strategy utilising what is available in the environment. Effective parent involvement has been a crucial factor in children’s education, and the present situation with Home-Based Learning (HBL) as norm stresses the significance even more. Thus, this workshop will explore how parents, as well as educators, could use stories and related activities creatively to offer a Mother Tongue language-rich environment at home or in a classroom.
