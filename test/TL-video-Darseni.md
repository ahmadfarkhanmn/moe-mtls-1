  <h4> Synposis</h4>  
       <p>Pedagogical theory strongly supports the use of stories in teaching languages to children. Keeping stories as the central part of language lessons not only contextualise language learning but also, pave the opportunity to illustrate and inspire young children. Carefully chosen activities related to the stories enable children naturally immerse in the experience as it provides a meaningful environment. Such proven strategy does not only belong to the educators or professionals. Anyone interested in a child’s learning and development could master this strategy utilising what is available in the environment. Effective parent involvement has been a crucial factor in children’s education, and the present situation with Home-Based Learning (HBL) as norm stresses the significance even more. Thus, this workshop will explore how parents, as well as educators, could use stories and related activities creatively to offer a Mother Tongue language-rich environment at home or in a classroom.
