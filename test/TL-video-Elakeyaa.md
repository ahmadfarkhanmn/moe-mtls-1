  <h4> Synopsis</h4>
       <p>The key issues currently amongst young Indian parents is on how to instil the interest in Tamil language and call-for action to do so with their young children. What they often miss is that, an interest for a language cannot be done via just tuitions, assessment books and practices. It has to be practical. It has to be fun. It has to be engaging and creative. In this workshop, I want to speak to the audience on how I never had any challenges getting my kids to speak Tamil or show interest in Tamil. But it takes effort to continuously cultivate this interest without the kids knowing that we want them to learn or show interest in this language. Key to success for this is to be discreet yet bold. And it takes the understanding of the concept and practical applications from parents to do so. Some examples will be merging learning with what we see, what we do and also to play along with what kids like to do. Kids love to imitate us, not just physically but also behaviourally. So why not make use of all these secret tools we have? That is the key focus in this session.
