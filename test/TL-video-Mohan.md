  <h4> Synopsis</h4> 
       <p>Family involvement and support play an integral role in a child’s foundation in learning a language. It is a collaborative effort between schools and parents as they work 
together to support every step that the child takes to learn and develop his/her language skills. Exposure to the Tamil language at home gives the children more opportunities to use the language in everyday life and it will make the learning in school complete. In today’s session, participants will learn how to create authentic opportunities and apply innovative strategies that they can use at home to foster the child’s learning of the Tamil language. They will discover creative ways for children to speak and learn Tamil through simple play routines at home.  They will also gain an understanding of the new primary curriculum, how it facilitates learning of Tamil language in a fun and enjoyable manner in school and how it supports home based learning as well.
